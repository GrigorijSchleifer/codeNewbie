```console
# my shell is zsh
exec zsh -1
```
  
```console
# to add an environmental variable permanently create one and export it
GS='grigorijschleifer'
export GS
```

```
So if you want to add your own variable that you can use later after bash session was terminated, you have to add this variable 
to a file that is source each time you start your shell. For me this is ~/.zshev file.
```

```console

GS='grigorijschleifer'
export GS
```
