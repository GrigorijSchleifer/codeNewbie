> <a href="https://github.com/GrigorijSchleifer/codeNewbie/tree/main/TMUX">TMUX</a>

Sourcing the ~/.tmux.conf file requires a different command compared to other dotfiles (configuration files with a leading dot in their names). 

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

TMUX basic commands (MAC)

* `ctrl a` or `ctrl t` prefix (needed for all command to follow)

* `ctrl a` + `shift %` splitting panes left and right
* `ctrl a` + `shift "` splitting panes top and down 
* `ctrl a` + `arrow keys` navigating between panes down
* `ctrl d` close a pane or type `exit`
* `ctrl a` + `c` creating a new window (window contains pains)
* `ctrl a`+ `n` switch to the next window
* `ctrl a`+ `p` switch to the previous window
* `ctrl a`+ `d` detach from a session (everything will still run in the background)

* `tmux ls` List the currently running sessions
* `tmux attach -t <sessionNumber>` attacht to a specific session  
* `tmux new -s database` attacht to a specific session

In Java, directly printing an array with System.out.println() will not print the contents of the array but will print its hashcode instead. To print the contents of the array, you need to use `Arrays.toString()` method from the `java.util.Arrays` class.

```java
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
```

SSH learning session and some bulletpoints for me to remember. 

* SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model
* remote machine must be running a piece of software called an SSH daemon
* The userâ€™s computer must have an SSH client
* passwords (less secure and not recommended) or SSH keys, which are very secure
* always setting up SSH key-based authentication for most configurations
* user must have an SSH key pair locally.
* public key must be copied to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on remote server

Reverse delete. Or some other name for deleting stuff to the right of the cursor. By typing `cntr d` ... baaaam!

> GIT

The `.gitignore` file contains names of folders and other files that Git ignores. These files are not automatically added to the staging area or included in commits. However, entries starting with an exclamation mark ("!") are an exception. These files will be included in a commit even though they are inside a folder that is otherwise ignored.

```bash
# file in out/ are excluded except `**/src/main/**/out/` and `**/src/test/**/out/`
out/
!**/src/main/**/out/
!**/src/test/**/out/
```

> VIM

This one is amazing! Enter the command mode by pressing `:` and use `up` or `down` keys to see your old commands. This will save me so much time!!!

> Terminal

Amazing way to use the last command. Just type `!!` and hit `tab` or `enter`. Even better if you like to use the command befor your last entry just type `!-2`. Or `!-4` and so on. Cool right!

* Typing `/**` + then pressing `Enter` above a method signature will create Javadoc stubs
* 'live templates' to generate several types of code snippets. `fori` for a for loop. Similar to `sout` for the print statement.

Adding code snippets. Handy!

```bash
# open command palette
shift option P

#### Showing PATH like a pro

```
Hey, what's up fellas. I'm trying to install Jekyll for running my own technical blog for doctors, but unfortunately 
I'm not able to update Ruby ... somehow I am stuck on an older version and don't know why I get a bunch of errors ... 
So while I'm trying to stay calm instead of throwing my Mac out of the OR, I found this little snippet that shows my PATH 
in a nice, concise way. Check it out ... and  yes, my PATH <br> is messed up ... the next ToDo is already planned ... 
see you later ... and as always ... sorry for my gebrochen english
```

[Link to a similar but more sophisticated tutorial](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/)

```console
echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g' | uniq -c
```

#### Bringing virtualenv to the next level


```
I am still new to virtual environment world but I already know that you must use virtual environments for your project 
to separatte stuff ... so I was wondering where I should create all my environments ... I know I have only a few but it 
turns out you should store the env's in ~ (your homne directory) ... oh Meister I hope it is true ... 
```
```console
# step I
mkdir ~/virtualenvs
# step 2
python -m virtualenv venv_name
# step 3
source venv_name/bin/activate
```
```
But the coolest thing ever ... you can save time by adding a function to your .zshrc and just use the funciton name plus the name of the environment to activate it ... niiiice
```
```bash
# add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc

export WORKON_HOME=~/virtualenvs # this is where you will store all your environments

 function workon {
     source "$WORKON_HOME/$1/bin/activate"
 }
```
   
```console
# to activate a environment just type
workon env_name
```

  <summary>Display avalable functions in iterm (zsh) </summary>
<br>
```
Hey, what is cookin ... I am adding some more functions to my bash. A neat new way to display all avalable function inside terminal is:
```

```console
declare -f
```

```
This command will show a huge amount of functions and if you would like to limit the output to only one terminal page than pipe the output 
of declare into less
```

```console
declare -f | less
```

```
You can move to the next matched pattern by pressing the n key or move back to the previous match by pressing the N (shift+n) key.
