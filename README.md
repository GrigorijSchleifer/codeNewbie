# codeNewbie: A Doctor's Journey into Coding

<p>Welcome to my coding diary! Here, I document my journey as a doctor exploring medical informatics, Python, R, and various other topics. This repository serves as a log of my learning process, experiments, and projects related to healthcare and programming.

I would not consider myself an expert in any of the topics covered here. I'm simply trying my best. If you find any mistakes (content- or language-related) please contact me via twitter or send me an email, thanks.</p>
