Teaching Platform for Strengthening Data Science Competence in Medicine

Digitalization has finally caught up with our everyday lives, impacting various areas of medicine. Medical data is growing increasingly complex, and accurately interpreting it is vital for ensuring patient safety. We aim to develop a platform for data science education that prepares healthcare colleagues for the challenges brought about by the digitalization of medicine.

The focus of this teaching platform will be to introduce digital tools from the field of Data Science and explain their application through clinical examples. By conducting interviews and coding sessions with experts in medical data science, we will solve concrete data science problems using statistical or analytical methods, ensuring they are explained in an understandable manner. Our learning platform is designed to create an environment where participants have the opportunity to learn how to analyze and interpret medical data, facilitated by video tutorials and interviews. To ensure high-quality teaching content, our development team receives support and guidance from trained medical didacticians.

Our project aims to help participants learn the necessary tools for medical data analysis and use them effectively in a healthcare system where medical data complexity is increasing, and analytical thinking is becoming more critical.
